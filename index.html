	Given the number of discplines and journals, the initial big scatter plot with each displine/journal occupying a single axis location may be too big or cluttered.  This is an alternative which may get the picture across more compactly whilst still allowing the user to dig into the data.  Think of it like a box-plot where each data point is represented.

	I have purposely left multiple years and countries in the plot simultaneously here just to demonstrate the 'swarming' look and feel the plot would have with many more displicines/journals in the data set.
