<br><br>
<div class='comm'>
	Given the number of discplines and journals, the initial big scatter plot with each displine/journal occupying a single axis location may be too big or cluttered.  This is an alternative which may get the picture across more compactly whilst still allowing the user to dig into the data.  Think of it like a box-plot where each data point is represented.
	<br><br>
	I have purposely left multiple years and countries in the plot simultaneously here just to demonstrate the 'swarming' look and feel the plot would have with many more displicines/journals in the data set.

<a href='./dynamic_beeswarm/index.html'>Dynamic 'Beeswarm' Demo</a>
<br><br>
<div class='comm'>
	Compared to the basic beeswarm above, the actual plot should be dynamic.  Here I've set up a slider that let's you go through the years of the dataset.  The data points animate in transition.
	<br><br>
	In reality, there'd be many more data points, and the buttons would be a dropdown box and all the filters would be arranged more neatly.

<a href='./disc_journ_scatter/index.html'>Discipline and Journal Scatter</a>
<br><br>
<div class='comm'>
	Based on your requested tab 1, plots 1 and 2.
	<br><br>
	Demos the basic mechanism of selecting years and countries.  No text or tooltips have been added yet.  Click any data point to bring up the journals plot.  To link disciplines with journals, this'll need to be added to the data.  Conf Ints are displayed as shaded rectangles on the presumption that the CIs are symmetrical about the mean (this can be altered if necessary).

	<br><br>
	Main concern here is that with many many more disciplines/journals, the plot will need to be quite large and be taller than a screen, or need to be cut in half and split into two columns.  I'll need a more realistic dataset to toy with that to see what is acceptable.
